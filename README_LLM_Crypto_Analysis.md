# üí∞ LLM-Powered Crypto Analysis Tool

An advanced **AI-powered cryptocurrency research assistant** that combines **LLaMA 3** (via **Groq API**) with **CrewAI agents** to analyze real-time market data, news, and trends in the crypto domain.  
This project leverages **LangChain**, **Exa API**, and **DuckDuckGo Search** to provide actionable crypto insights ‚Äî summarized and interpreted through an intelligent multi-agent workflow.

## üß© Project Overview

The **LLM-Powered Crypto Analysis Tool** is designed to help users understand market movements, emerging tokens, and sentiment shifts using an ensemble of agents:  
- **News Agent** ‚Üí Gathers latest crypto news via Exa API  
- **Market Analyst Agent** ‚Üí Interprets numerical data and patterns  
- **Summary Agent** ‚Üí Generates concise, human-readable insights using LLaMA 3

These agents collaborate under **CrewAI**, orchestrating tasks intelligently for end-to-end crypto analysis.
